# Mini power supply

# Brief
The purpose of this project is to create a mini power supply with three channels for three different voltage values(12CV, 5V, 3,3V).
The power supply has voltage and current indicators.
For proper operation of the power supply, it must be connected to a voltage of 12V DC.
