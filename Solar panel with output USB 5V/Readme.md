# Solar panel with output USB 5V

# Brief
The purpose of this project is to create a solar panel with a 5V converter with a current capacity of 1A.
To achieve the efficiency of 1A, 9 solar cells were connected in parallel. The voltage converter, on the other hand, is enclosed in a housing with a voltage and current indicator.
